Reverse engineering material for the HyperX Pulsefire Haste mouse.

This repo contains documentation (in the protocol directory) and an application to configure this mouse. The application isn't being maintained anymore, and is more of a proof of concept. If you just want to configure your mouse, I wouldn't recommend using this application, as it could possibly damage and/or brick your mouse. For information about building the application see [BUILD.md](https://github.com/evan-razzaque/open-pulsefire-haste/blob/main/BUILD.md).
